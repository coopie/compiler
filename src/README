WACC COMPILER NOTES

AST:
The components of the AST are either one of the tow classes (implements WaccAST):
- Nodes of the AST :
-- Expr
-- All classes derived from Stat
-- Func
-- Program
--
 
- Objects that are not nodes implements ParseTreeReturnable : 
-- Arglist
-- Param
-- ParamList
-- Literals (contained within an Expr node)
-- Ops (same as above)
-- Types
-- 



Naming conventions:
- Nodes:
-- Must have a suffix AST.
- Not Nodes:
-- Do not.


Semantics that is implemented to be checked (write " - TESTED" for the ones tests are written):
- return type of function called should match the assignable it is matched to
- arguments of function call should match the params of the function
- expression types should check
- variables can't be redeclared in scope
- variables are declared before use
- if statments's expr should be bool
- while statments's cond should be bool
- return gets called only in a function
- return must return the type the function sginature requires

Error Handling:
This is done by creating an ErrorRecord Object,(implentation tbd)


Interfaces
Assignable - For identifiers, pair-elems, array-elems (able to be found in the symbol table)

Scope
    Scope is equvivalent to symbolTable reference. So each statement has a reference to the symbol table, which also inherently defines the scope.
